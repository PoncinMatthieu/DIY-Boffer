# In making: Boffer Shield
> February 12, 2018

## Introduction
This post shows how I made my Spartan shield. This requires quite a bit more work than the [Spartan Sword](first_boffer_sword.md) but this is still as easy.
The shield will be round shaped of at least 85 cm of diameters.

As I am trying to follow the Sotahuuto rules, the shield has to be padded all over, even on the front.



## Skeleton
First starting with plywood. What I've got is 9mm thick (TODO COST), it looks quite sturdy so it should be pretty good. I think I might have been able to save up on the wieght with even thinner plywood and some reenforcement crossing the center.

Drawing up the structural shape of the shield..

Then cutting the board with a jigsaw.

Next up, I drilled a few holes and placed in a handle (cost 4.25â‚¬ from KRauta).

Notice the shape of the screws I used, I thought these would be good idea whenever I need to tighten it up from the handle side (the other side will be wrapped up coverd by padding and cloth!

This shield is meant to be supported by the forearm as well, so i've cut a piece of garden hose for this one (I later on replaced it for a piece of cloth as I found the hose was not flexible enough and painful on the arm.

Finally to finish with the shield skeleton, I wraped the edges with garden hose. This is to make sure their is no hard edges and the padding around it will endure chocs.

## Pading
Now this is already a very nice looking shield in my opinion, but sadly we have put put in all this padding.

Around the edges with isolation pipe... (TODO COST)

## Accessories
Then I'm adding small extras before finishing up the shield.

Here is some kind of gym strap that I'll use to carry the shield around on my back. (TODO COST)

A hook and loop tape, this is for attaching my sword on the shield when fighting with spear. (TODO COST)

And some more padding for some stability and comfort while handling the shield.

## Wrap up
Then to protect the padding from bad weather and for stealth at night, some black fabric :p (TODO COST)

## Logo
It's almost over, but the shield would be quite blend without a logo, so here it goes. I first made a pattern using some cardboard boxed and a small white textile pen.

## Conclusion
It's winter now and I didn't get the chance to use the shield yet... But i'm eager to and hopefully use it for next Sotahuuto.
Total cost was: (TODO COST)
