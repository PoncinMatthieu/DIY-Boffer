# In making: Boffer Shield
> February 12, 2018

## Introduction
This post shows how I made my Spartan shield. This requires quite a bit more work than the [Spartan Sword](first_boffer_sword.md) but this is still as easy.
The shield will be round shaped of at least 85 cm of diameters.

As I am trying to follow the Sotahuuto rules, the shield has to be padded all over, even on the front.



## Skeleton
First starting with plywood. What I've got is 9mm thick, you can find it in size of 9mm * 1.2m x 2.4m at 24.9€ in Bauhaus, enough to make 2 shields. It looks quite sturdy so it should be pretty good. I think I might have been able to save up on the weight with even thinner plywood and some reinforcement crossing the center.

Drawing up the structural shape of the shield..

Then cutting the board with a jigsaw.

Next up, I drilled a few holes and placed in a handle. The handle cost 4.25€ from KRauta.

Notice the shape of the screws I used, I thought these would be good idea whenever I need to tighten it up from the handle side (the other side will be wrapped up and coverd by padding and cloth!

This shield is meant to be supported by the forearm as well, so I've cut a piece of garden hose for this one (I later on replaced it for a piece of cloth as I found the hose was not flexible enough and painful on the arm)

Finally to finish with the shield skeleton, I wraped the edges with garden hose. This is to make sure there is no hard edges and the padding around it will endure chocs. It's also very cheap, only 4.95€ for 20 meters.

## Padding
Now this is already a very nice looking shield in my opinion, but sadly we have to put in all this padding.

Around the edges we need isolation pipe. I used 3 of them and they cost 2.5€ a piece from Bauhaus.

And on the front, a yoga mat will do the job. At 4.95€ from Etola.

## Accessories
Then I'm adding small extras before finishing up the shield. Those are all quite optional.

Here is some kind of gym strap that I'll use to carry the shield around on my back. This is I think the most expensive piece but can't remember the price and didn't keep the receipt.

A hook and loop tape, this is for attaching my sword on the shield when fighting with spear. Same for this one, it was quite expensive but don't remember the price unfortunately.

And some more padding for stability and comfort while handling the shield.

## Wrap up
Then to protect the padding from bad weather and for stealth at night, I added black fabric :p

The fabric was 14.28€ for 1.2x1.2 meters.

## Logo
It's almost over, but the shield would be quite blend without a logo, so here it goes. I first made a pattern using some cardboard boxes and a small white textile pen.

Barbabeau says hi! :D

## Conclusion
It's winter now and I didn't get the chance to use the shield yet... But i'm eager to try it and hopefully use it for next Sotahuuto.
Total cost of the shield was 60.83 euros without the accessories, this was certainly more costly than the Sword I made earlier but most of the things I bought actually can be reused. I'd need to buy only very few things to build a second shield/sword.
